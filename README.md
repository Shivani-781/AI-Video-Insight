## **Note:
This project relies on the YouTube API. Due to restrictions on cloud-hosted apps, API calls may be blocked when using the public Streamlit link. The app is deployed using [proxy servers](https://www.webshare.io/features/free-proxy), so there is approximately a 50% chance the app will work online. For best results, run the app locally or use a paid API plan.

## Features
* **Summarize Video**: Automatically extract important topics and generate summary notes from any YouTube video.
* **Chat with Video**: Interactively ask questions about the video content and get AI-powered answers.
* **Multi-language support**: Transcribes videos in various languages and provides summaries, even if the video is not in English.
* **Easy-to-use interface**: Streamlined sidebar input for video URL, language, and task selection.

### Limitations

**Cloud Deployment**:

**Recommended**:
For full functionality, run the app locally with your own API key.
Alternatively, consider a paid API plan for higher reliability.
